# ESO-AutoBanker
Autobank items found in you bank that are in your inventory 

Works as long as the item in your bank is not a full stack. IE: if you got a full (200) stack of rocks in your bank then it can't transfer the 40 rocks that are in your inventory. If you got 50 cute frogs in your bank which can stack to 100, and got 20 in your inventory then this addon will be able to put thoses 20 cute frogs into your bank to keep them safe :)

Affects all items in your inventory, including gear. I'll be looking into allowing you to filter what types of items you want AutoBanking.
